### Cyclistic bike share analysis case study

Situation: 

The "Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis" project was conducted as part of a capstone project for analyzing bike-share trip data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. The analysis aimed to understand user behavior and provide recommendations for improving the service.

Task:

The primary task was to analyze the bike-share trip data to identify patterns and insights related to user behavior, ride duration, and the difference between casual riders and members.

Action:

Collecting Data: Multiple CSV files containing monthly trip data were loaded and combined into a single data frame.
Inspecting Data: The combined data frame's structure and summary statistics were examined to understand the dataset.
Cleaning Data: Unnecessary columns were removed, new columns for date, month, day, year, and day of the week were added, and ride length was calculated. Negative ride lengths and extreme outliers were filtered out.
Analyzing Data: Comparisons were made between casual riders and members, including average ride length and ride patterns by day of the week. Aggregated data was analyzed for insights.
Visualizing Data: Visualizations were created to show the number of rides and average ride duration by rider type (casual vs. member) and day of the week.
Saving Data: Cleaned and summarized data was saved as CSV files for further analysis and visualization in Tableau.

Result: The analysis revealed several key insights:

Casual riders tend to have longer ride durations compared to members.
Members exhibit more consistent riding patterns throughout the week, while casual riders have higher variability.
The data showed peak usage times and popular stations, helping identify potential areas for service improvements.
